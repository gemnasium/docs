Prerequisites
=============

Subscriptions
-------------

* As Gemnasium Enterprise is provided as a docker image, you must have a `Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com>`_ or `Quay <https://quay.io>`_ account to download it.
* A Gemnasium Enterprise license is required. If do not have your license yet, please contact our `support <email:support@gemnasium.com>`_.

System Requirements
-------------------

Hardware
^^^^^^^^

* Physical or virtual system, or an instance running on a public or private IaaS.
* 1 vCPU
* Minimum of 2GB RAM
* Minimum 20GB hard disk space

Software
^^^^^^^^

* OS: RedHat (RHEL, Atomic Host, Centos & Fedora flavors), Debian Stable. Any OS running docker should work but is not officially supported.
* Docker >= 1.9.1

License key
-----------

As you will see, in all the ``docker run`` commands, there is a ``-e LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_OWN_LICENSE_KEY \``. You need to replace ``YOUR_OWN_LICENSE_KEY`` with the license we gave you. If you don't have one, please get in touch and we'll get that sorted.
